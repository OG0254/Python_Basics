# Chained condtions

# and - .Both conditions must be true for program to run
# or - Either of the conditions should be true for program to run
# not - It reverses everything you have given in the bracket thus if it's true it will turn it to false and vise versa

# Nested if statements (works same as and but at times we need the if statement)

# if _ _ _ _
#   if _ _ _ _ - you can add as many if statements as posiible
#       print(_ _ _ _)
#   else:
#       print(_ _ _ _)

# else:
#   print(_ _ _ _)
