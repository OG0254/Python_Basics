# Set up the SMTP server
with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as smtp:

# What to do:
# You need to generate an App Password â€” a special 16-character code just for your Python email-sending app.

# ðŸ“Œ How to Get an App Password:
# Go to: Google Account Security Settings

# Scroll down to Signing in to Google

# Ensure 2-Step Verification is turned ON

# After itâ€™s on, go back to that section â€” youâ€™ll see App Passwords

# Select App Passwords

# Choose:

# App: Mail

# Device: Other (name it something like PythonScript)

# Google will give you a 16-character password â€” no spaces
# Example: abcd efgh ijkl mnop

# Use that code in your smtp.login() in place of your regular password

# ðŸ“Œ Then run your script again â€” should be flawless.
# No more SMTPAuthenticationError.

# i will creat e a dummy account for testing purposes later
