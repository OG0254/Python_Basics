# Favorite Foods
# Write a Python program that:

# Creates a tuple of your 3 favorite foods.

# Prints the second food from the tuple.

# Prints the total number of items in the tuple.

# Tries to change one item in the tuple (just try it, to see what happens).

print('--- Favorite Foods ---\n')

food = ('Chicken', 'Rice', 'Fish')
print(f'Second food is: {food[1]}')
print(f'Total number of items: {len(food)}')
